Reinforce and teach basic arithmetic through a timed quiz.  
When the player reaches 100 points, 
they are given their time to complete quiz and their accuracy.  
All actions performed in console.  

(This is a personal project to practice OOP principles.  However, I could see programs like this actually being of great benefit to elementary school students 
to reinforce the basics of arithmetic.  The program could be expanded to include higher levels of math as well.)
